It turns out we spent a decent amount of time on repetitive tasks and on fixing screw ups that resulted after a part of a repetitive task was forgotten. With a minimal one-time investment in devOps, the productivity of the team increased considerably. Why? I think the massive confidence boost automation provides is an important factor.',
